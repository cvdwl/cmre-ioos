## Matlab scripts for demonstrating standards-based search, access and use
These scripts use CSW for search, OPeNDAP for access, and CF Conventions to facilitate use.

These tools require the NCTOOLBOX for making use of CF conventions.   The Native NetCDF/OPeNDAP tools do not know anything about CF conventions. 

Installation:
* install [NCTOOLBOX](http://nctoolbox.github.io/nctoolbox/) (get the stable version)
* download the cmre scripts: `git clone https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/cmre-ioos.git` or [download the zip file](https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/cmre-ioos/archive/master.zip)
